# Covid Tests Simulation

At the beginning of the COVID epidemic, viral tests were in short supply (shortage of collection kits (i.e. nasal swabs), shortage of staff to analyze collected samples, etc.) In May 2020, The New York Times published an article [*Five People. One Test. This is how you get there*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-group-testing.html) that describes a method experimented in Nebraska where **group testing is used : samples from 5 people are pooled and one test is used. If the test comes back negative, you can clear all those people with one test. If it comes back positive, you retest the peopleâ€™s samples individually.** 

One thing to note is that this method works because **diluted samples are still usable**. Intuitively, this method should work when the proportion of the population infected is small. And when that proportion is big, it should result in more tests. 

**So does this method really result in fewer tests ? And if so, to what proportion of the infected population does this method still work?**
